# ACC_Parallel
In this repository we propose acceleration on three architecture :
- Multiprocessor: Multiprocessor CPU
- Manyprocessor: GPU
- Distributed cluster: Distributed CPU

In each architecture we have acceleration code with python and C.

Multiprocessor CPU + python: Numba library
Distributed CPU + C: MPI

GPU + python: Numba library (using CUDA)
GPU + C: CUDA
